Firstly, copy and paste the python script into the directory you want to fill gaps.
Then, edit the python file so that the name and numbering scheme matches the scheme of the 
files. (Ex: change match = re.match(r"test(\d+)\.png", file) to match = re.match(r"Rendered_image(\d+)\.png", file))
Change the directories as well in fill_gaps function, and change the first file's numbering to match 
Then open Anaconda Script, create a pillow env (conda create -n pillow-test pillow) and activate it
(conda activate pillow-test)
move to directory if not already in it, then run the program (python fill_gaps.py)
it should have added empty image files.
